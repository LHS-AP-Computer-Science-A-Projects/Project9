# Project 9
**Instructions**<br>
Select one of three sports, football, hockey, or basketball, and create a program that calculates at least one of statistics provided below:<br>

Football: Calculate the team’s winning percentage.<br>
Hockey: Calculate S% (percentage of shots that end up scoring a goal).<br>
Basketball: Calculate a player's three point percentage.<br>

The program will contain two classes. The main class will request the user to enter all necessary information to determine the statistic, and the server class will take that information and calculate the sport statistic selected.<br>

The main class should contain:<br>
• The main method.<br>
• A server object.<br>
• A request for the user to enter all necessary information and pass it as parameters to the server class.<br>
• A display of the statistic, passed back from the server class.<br>

The server class should contain:<br>
• A constructor method.<br>
• Private variables needed to accomplish the task.<br>
• All private variables instantiated inside the constructor.<br>
• At least 3 methods, including the toString() and constructor methods.<br>
